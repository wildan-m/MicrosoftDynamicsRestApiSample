# Web API CDSWebApiService Basic Operations Sample

This Sample demonstrates how to perform basic CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete) and associative operations using the CDSWebApiService class with the Common Data Service Web API.

The CDSWebApiService class provides helper methods that are aligned to the  Http methods used, with some variations for different use cases. It helps to reduce duplication of code found in the other BasicOperations sample.

The CDSWebApiService class also demonstrates best practices for managing an HttpClient and properly handling Service Protection Limit 429 errors that client applications should expect.
